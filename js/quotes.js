      `The Tao that can be understood is not the eternal, cosmic Tao,
      just as an idea that can be expressed in words is not the infinite idea.<br><br>
      And yet this ineffable Tao is the source of all spirit and matter;
      expressing itself
      it is the mother of all created things.<br><br>
      Not to desire material things
      is to know the freedom of spirituality;
      and to desire them is to suffer
      the limitations of matter.<br><br>
      Yet these two things, matter and spirit,
      so different in nature, have the same origin.<br><br>
      This unity is the mystery of mysteries,
      and the gateway to spirituality.`,

      `When beauty is only a masquerade,

      is not really goodness.<br><br>
      Existence and nonexistence are incompatible.
      The difficult and the easy are mutually opposed.
      The long and the short, the high and the low,
      the loud and soft, the before and after--
      all are opposites.
      Each reveals the other.<br><br>
      The wise are not conspicuous in their actions
      or given to much talking.
      When troubles arise,
      they are not irritated.<br><br>
      They produce, but do not hoard,
      They act, but expect no praise,
      They build, but do not dwell therein.<br><br>
      And because they do not dwell therein,
      they never depart.`,
