    {quote: `The Tao that can be understood is not the eternal, cosmic Tao, just as an idea that can be expressed in words is not the infinite idea.
    <br><br>And yet this ineffable Tao is the source of all spirit and matter;
    expressing itself
    it is the mother of all created things.<br><br>
  Not to desire material things
    is to know the freedom of spirituality;
    and to desire them is to suffer
    the limitations of matter.<br><br>
  Yet these two things, matter and spirit,
    so different in nature, have the same origin.<br><br>
  This unity is the mystery of mysteries,
    and the gateway to spirituality.`,
