      `The Tao that can be understood is not the eternal, cosmic Tao,
      just as an idea that can be expressed in words is not the infinite idea.<br><br>
      And yet this ineffable Tao is the source of all spirit and matter;
      expressing itself
      it is the mother of all created things.<br><br>
      Not to desire material things
      is to know the freedom of spirituality;
      and to desire them is to suffer
      the limitations of matter.<br><br>
      Yet these two things, matter and spirit,
      so different in nature, have the same origin.<br><br>
      This unity is the mystery of mysteries,
      and the gateway to spirituality.`,

      `When beauty is only a masquerade,
      it is actually ugliness.
      And goodness, if it is not sincere,
      is not really goodness.<br><br>
      Existence and nonexistence are incompatible.
      The difficult and the easy are mutually opposed.
      The long and the short, the high and the low,
      the loud and soft, the before and after--
      all are opposites.
      Each reveals the other.<br><br>
      The wise are not conspicuous in their actions
      or given to much talking.
      When troubles arise,
      they are not irritated.<br><br>
      They produce, but do not hoard,
      They act, but expect no praise,
      They build, but do not dwell therein.<br><br>
      And because they do not dwell therein,
      they never depart.`,

      `When a ruler is silent on the subject of virtue,
      the people are discouraged from practicing it.
      Meanwhile, a ruler who revels in riches encourages thievery.<br><br>
      Value virtue over wealth,
      and the people's hearts will be at rest.<br><br>
      Wise rulers do not accumulate treasures,
      but seek to quiet the hearts of their people.
      They soothe the people's appetites and strengthen their bones.
      They treasure innocence, and protect the simple from the schemes of the clever.<br><br>
      When a ruler practices restraint, everything will be in place.`,

      It existed before anything.<br><br>

      breaks its own bonds,

      identifies with its own dust.<br><br>

      The space between earth and the stars is like a bellows--it is empty but does not collapse;

      The wise humble themselves--
      and because of their humility, they are worthy of praise.
      They put others first, and so become great.<br><br>
      They are not focused on outcomes or achievements;

      Like water, it ever seeks the lowest place,
      the place that all others avoid.<br><br>
      This is the way of the Tao.
      For a dwelling it chooses the quiet meadow;
      for a heart the circling eddy.<br><br>
      In generosity it is kind;
      in speech it is sincere;
      in power it is order;
      in action it is gentle;

      wise rulers act like mother birds.
      While seeing into every corner,
      they are unobtrusive.
      While protecting the people,
      they do not control them.<br><br>

      In returning to the root, we find tranquility;
      this leads to our destiny, which is eternity.
      To know eternity is enlightenment;
      to ignore eternity is to invite calamity.<br><br>
      Knowing eternity means seeing the big picture;
      seeing the big-picture is broad-minded;
      breadth of vision brings nobility;
