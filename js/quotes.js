      `The Tao that can be understood is not the eternal, cosmic Tao,
      just as an idea that can be expressed in words is not the infinite idea.<br><br>
      And yet this ineffable Tao is the source of all spirit and matter;
      expressing itself
      it is the mother of all created things.<br><br>
      Not to desire material things
      is to know the freedom of spirituality;
      and to desire them is to suffer
      the limitations of matter.<br><br>
      Yet these two things, matter and spirit,
      so different in nature, have the same origin.<br><br>
      This unity is the mystery of mysteries,
      and the gateway to spirituality.`,

      `When beauty is only a masquerade,
      it is actually ugliness.
      And goodness, if it is not sincere,
      is not really goodness.<br><br>
      Existence and nonexistence are incompatible.
      The difficult and the easy are mutually opposed.
      The long and the short, the high and the low,
      the loud and soft, the before and after--
      all are opposites.
      Each reveals the other.<br><br>
      The wise are not conspicuous in their actions
      or given to much talking.
      When troubles arise,
      they are not irritated.<br><br>
      They produce, but do not hoard,
      They act, but expect no praise,
      They build, but do not dwell therein.<br><br>
      And because they do not dwell therein,
      they never depart.`,

      `When a ruler is silent on the subject of virtue,
      the people are discouraged from practicing it.
      Meanwhile, a ruler who revels in riches encourages thievery.<br><br>
      Value virtue over wealth,
      and the people's hearts will be at rest.<br><br>
      Wise rulers do not accumulate treasures,
      but seek to quiet the hearts of their people.
      They soothe the people's appetites and strengthen their bones.
      They treasure innocence, and protect the simple from the schemes of the clever.<br><br>
      When a ruler practices restraint, everything will be in place.`,

      `The Tao seems empty, yet it is never exhausted.<br><br>
      Oh, it is profound!
      It existed before anything.<br><br>
      It dulls its own sharpness,
      breaks its own bonds,
      dims its own brightness,
      identifies with its own dust.<br><br>
      Oh, it is peaceful!
      It is infinite, eternal.<br><br>
      No one knows from where it came.
      It is older than the gods.<br>`,
